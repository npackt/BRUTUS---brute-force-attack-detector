# BRUTUS---brute-force-attack-detector
BRUTUS is an open source and free tool I am developing to detect brute force attacks against computers in a network. It operate by checking the security logs of every computer in the network and organizing them into a clean UI that makes it clear when a computer is being attacked. The program can also be configured to text system administrators when an attack is taking place. Brutus can be configured to respond to the brute force attack by disconnecting the comuter from the internet and changing the password to a randomly hashed sequence which will be texted to the system administor.
