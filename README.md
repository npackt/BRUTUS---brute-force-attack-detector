# BRUTUS---brute-force-attack-detector
BRUTUS is an open source and free tool I am developing to detect brute force attacks against computers in a network. It operate by checking the security logs of every computer in the network and organizing them into a clean UI that makes it clear when a computer is being attacked. The program can also be configured to text system administrators when an attack is taking place.
