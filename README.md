# BRUTUS---brute-force-attack-detector
BRUTUS is an open source and free tool(IDS) I am developing to detect and respond to brute force login attacks against computers in a network. It operate by checking the security logs of every computer in the network and organizing them into a clean UI that makes it clear when a computer is being attacked. The program can also be configured to text system administrators when an attack is taking place. Brutus can be configured to respond to the brute force attack by disconnecting the computer that is under attack from the internet (turning off wifi, deactivating the respective port on a managed CISCO switch, or shutting down the computer) and changing the password to a randomly hashed sequence which will be sent to the system administor. BRUTUS stores logs on a central computer(master) or server managed directly by system administrators and can also be used to keep a record of irregular log ins.
